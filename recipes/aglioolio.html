    <p>Pasta aglio e olio is one of those classic Italian recipes that is more than the sum of its parts.
        It's a quick meal that can come together in the span of about 15 minutes, and originally was invented
        by poor Southern Italian families as a quick meal that could be made with cheap, readily available ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>The name, Aglio e Olio, referrs to the primary ingredients of the sauce: garlic and oil. And really that's all
        it is. You thinly slice some garlic and gently fry it in oil which forms the base of the sauce. You get a
        garlic oil that coats every noodle in rich garlicky goodness. Then you finish the sauce with chili flakes,
        chopped parsley, and a touch of lemon.

    <h3>You will need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a pot to cook the pasta</li>
        <li>an 8-10in skillet</li>
        <li>long pasta of your choice (usually spaghetti)</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>chili flakes</li>
        <li>Italian (flat-leaf) parsley</li>
        <li>a lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking your pasta in generously salted water (<em>salata come il mare</em>) according to package instructions</li>
        <li>Pre-heat your pan to medium-low, adding a heavy pour of olive oil</li>
        <li>While pasta is boiling, slice your garlic into fine slices</li>
        <li>Add your garlic to the pan. It should begin to gently sizzle. If it's sizzling aggressively your heat is too high.</li>
        <li>While the garlic fries, finely chop your parsley</li>
        <li>Add the chili flakes to the garlic oil. How much depends on heat preference</li>
        <li>When the garlic begins to show light browning, take it off the heat</li>
        <li>Once your pasta is <em>al dente</em>, remove it with tongs and toss it with the garlic oil. The goal is to take a little of the starchy pasta water and emulsify it with the oil to form a sauce that clings to the pasta</li>
        <li>Add chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice, then toss to combine</li>
        <li>Plate and enjoy! To get the nice restaurant style presentation, you can use a grill fork to twirl the pasta, or your tongs and a soup ladle</li>
    </ol>
