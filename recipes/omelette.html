    <p>The classic French omelette is a very simple recipe, but difficult to master.
        It has a light, fluffy texture, and pairs well with any number of fillings.
        I like chives and a nice cheese, like a gruyere or a mild cheddar.
        Other options like mushrooms, spinach, or tomatoes are also delicious.

    <h3>You will need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a nonstick pan</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>a silicon spatula</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>(optional) your choice of filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your pan to medium high</li>
        <li>While the pan is heating, crack your eggs into a bowl and whisk them until smooth. If you're using herbs, add them to the eggs here</li>
        <li>Put butter in the pan and let it mostly melt. If it's bubbling and gently hissing you're at a good temp</li>
        <li>When the butter is mostly melted and the pan is coated, add your eggs</li>
        <li>Aggressively agitate the eggs with your spatula to create small curds. You can also shake the pan back and forth as you do this to increase the egg movement</li>
        <li>When the eggs have mostly set but are still a bit runny (about 2 minutes), let them rest briefly to form a solid skin. Or don't and just have scrambled eggs. Live your life.</li>
        <li>Hold the pan angled slightly down, and tap on the handle with your other hand. The goal is to move the omelette to the edge of the pan, eventually above the lip</li>
        <li>Using the spatula, fold the part of the omelette that peeks over the lip down, and continue tapping until the eggs have almost folded in half</li>
        <li>At this point you can add whatever fillings you like</li>
        <li>Shape the corners of the omelette to points, creating almost a football shape</li>
        <li>Grabbing the handle of the pan in an underhand grip, invert the pan to deposit your omelette on the plate</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
